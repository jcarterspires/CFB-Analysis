# With the SEC as an example, this plots QB/WR recruiting for a specified time period vs offensive pass EPA for a given year
# And then similarly, DB recruiting vs defensive pass EPA
# You can play around with how much of the previous five years of recruiting you want to include
# Each plot includes a linear regression line to show the general trend, and an lm object you can check the summary for to see the actual fit
# This includes the pbp_[year] and cfb_logos dfs that were created in the "PBP" script; creating the defense_conference column is helpful for this
