# CFB-Analysis
R Scripts I use to do CFB Analysis and Viz

Major thanks to the whole team at cfbscrapR (particularly to Parker Fleming for his tutorial on getting started with the package), and to the team at collegefootballdata.com.

Most of my analysis is done with Rice and Alabama, as those are my teams and alma maters, but of course the code could be adapted for any team.
